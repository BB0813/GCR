Git semantic commit message conventions:  
1. feat: New feature, used to mark a commit that adds a new functionality. Whenever the development team adds a completely new functional module, extends the boundaries of existing functionality, or introduces innovative interaction logic, they can prefix the commit message with feat  
2. fix: Bug fix, meaning this commit is to fix an existing problem in the project. The scope of problems here is broad, including code logic errors, interface display abnormalities, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities  
3. docs: Documentation modification, specifically for updating project documentation, whether modifying README files, updating API manuals, or improving code comments within the project, all can use this prefix  
4. style: Style modification, when modifying CSS, LESS, SCSS and other style sheet files, or adjusting inline styles in HTML, it's appropriate to use the style prefix, precisely indicating that this commit only involves changes in visual style, without affecting business logic and functionality implementation
5. refactor: Code refactoring, representing code restructuring, that is, optimizing the structure and design patterns of existing code. The code functionality remains unchanged, only improving code quality, readability, and maintainability. If a lengthy, highly coupled function is split into several small functions with clear responsibilities, you can write git commit -m "refactor: decompose large user registration function". Team members seeing this commit message will clearly know that there's an optimization action in the code architecture, but the functionality still operates as usual, and when reviewing the code, they can focus on the code structure  
6. perf: Performance optimization, discovering that a database query operation takes too long, and after algorithm optimization, significantly improving query speed. At this time, the commit message can be git commit -m "perf: speed up database query with index optimization". When developers and operations personnel later investigate performance bottlenecks, such commit records are key clues  
7. test: Testing, covering both adding new test cases and updating existing test methods. For example, git commit -m "test: add unit tests for new payment gateway" indicates adding unit tests for a new payment gateway feature; git commit -m "test: update integration tests after API change" indicates updating integration tests after an API change  
8. build: Build, used when making changes to project build scripts or build tool configuration files. For example, upgrading from Webpack 4 to Webpack 5, the commit message is written as git commit -m "build: upgrade webpack from version 4 to 5", letting colleagues responsible for deployment and continuous integration quickly know that there are adjustments in the build process  
9. ci: Continuous integration, modifying files and configurations related to the continuous integration process, such as .gitlab-ci.yml or .travis.yml configuration files for CI platforms, using git commit -m "ci: add new step to GitHub Actions pipeline" to inform the team that this commit is related to the optimization or extension of the CI process
10. chore: Routine maintenance, changing versions of old third-party libraries in the project, cleaning up redundant files in the project directory, and other such chores, can be marked as chore: clean up unused project files", meaning there's no substantial impact on the core business, but rather making the project environment healthier
11. revert: Rollback, when discovering that the previous commit introduced new problems and needing to cancel that commit, use revert. For example, git commit -m "revert: undo last feat commit due to breaking bug", simply and clearly indicating the cancellation of the last feature commit, because it produced a serious bug


MkDocs basic commands:  
1. Create project: ```mkdocs new [project name]```  
2. Start service: ```mkdocs serve```  
3. Build documentation: ```mkdocs build```  
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages: ```mkdocs gh-deploy```  
5. View help information: ```mkdocs --help```
